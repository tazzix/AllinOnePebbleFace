This Pebble Watchface is what I developed for my needs. I had to constantly flip between watchfaces and decided
to develop one which could do everythin I needed.

This has:
- big time
- full date (day of week, date, month)
- weather information (condition, temp, hi, low, humidity, sunrise, sunset) on main screen
- weather forecast (3 day condition, hi, lowO on second screen (wrist flick)
- pedometer (steps)
- idle (sleep?) time monitor (hour/minutes)
- Islamic prayer times, next prayer time on main screen, all five times on second (wrist flick)
- City / location name

- Last data is cached to avoid empty screen if watchface is reloaded in a no-network environment
